<h2> About my Favorite Books !! </h2>
<p>This section will showcase my favorite sagas/series. To start off, I love the Boys of Tommen book series with my whole soul. All 6 books and the more to come. I feel like they have raised my standards and I genuinely connet with the universe. (And now I want to travel to Ireland). Another book saga I adorewith my whole being is the Shatter Me series, which is a dystopian novel with a romance subplot. I wasn´t a big fan of the first book but now that I read the rest, I grew to love it.</p>
